#Welcome to the 2D-Runner Game Operation_X-Scape! This was a project designed for TechWise, an eighteen-month
virtual program offered by TalentSprint in partnership with Google, with the assistance of my team mate Ugochukwu Osondu.

#Below are listed the steps to install/run the game:
#1. Download all of the files in this repository.
#2. Ensure sure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your device.
#3. Run the file titled "Operation_X-Scape.py" in Visual Studio Code.
#4. Enjoy!

#Be sure to message me about any potential issues you have with the steps or the project itself.

#Thank you for your interest and I hope you enjoy!
